## what is this?
this is a batch script to grab my suggested mods for minecraft b1.7.3
## how do i install a mod?
tutorial below is for multimc and it's various forks.
select the instance in multimc and click "edit instance", on the "version" tab click on "add to minecraft.jar" and select every jar & zip file in the "add-to-minecraft" folder. after you're done with that click the "mods" tab and choose "add file" and add each jar & zip file in the "add-to-mods" folder.
## where do you get the download links for the mods?
i attempt them directly from the original link, if not possible i'll get them from the most reputable archive.
## i have a mod i think should be added.
make an issue or pull request
